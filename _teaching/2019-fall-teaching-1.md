This course gives students a solid grounding in mathematical topics essential for the analysis of biological systems.

## Course overview

Both analytical and numerical topics are covered and include:
* basic algebra revision
* graphs and plotting
* differentiation and integration
* differential equations
* linear algebra
* systems of differential equations and their analysis.

Students will use Python to perform both symbolic and numeric computation, alongside pen-and-paper calculation.

## Lectures and practical sessions

The course consists of 16 one-hour lectures, followed by 2.5-hour practical sessions to work through problems based on the material covered during the lecture.

Each practical session consists of a problem sheet, and a subset of the problems will be handed in for assessment.
