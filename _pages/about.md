Welcome to Chon Lok Lei's research homepage.

I am a D.Phil. (a.k.a. Ph.D.) student at the [Computational Biology group](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/compbio) in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk) (see my [offical university page](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/chonlok.lei)).

My research interest is in mathematical/computational modelling of biological/physiological systems.
I work on human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) electrophysiology and the hERG channel modelling for studying pharmaceutical drug safety.
I am also interested in using statistical methods for solving and analysing complex models and dynamical systems, and quantifying the uncertainty in the model parameters and model predictions.

See my [publications page]({{ base_path }}/publications) for my recent work.
