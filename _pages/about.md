Welcome to Chon Lok Lei's research homepage.

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Faculty of Health Sciences](https://fhs.um.edu.mo/en/) at the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) (see [my official university page](https://fhs.um.edu.mo/en/staff/chon-lok-lei/)).
I completed my doctoral degree as a [Clarendon scholar](https://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) at the [Computational Biology group](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/compbio) in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk) (see [my previous university page](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/chonlok.lei)),
before which I attended training programmes at the [Doctoral Training Centre](http://www.dtc.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford,
and I received my undergraduate degree in Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

My research interest is in mathematical/computational modelling of biological/physiological systems.
Primarily I work on cardiac cellular electrophysiology, including human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and their ion channels, constructing and refining computational models for studying pharmaceutical drug safety, and some of models are being used as part of the new model development for drug safety testing with [Roche](https://www.roche.com).
I am also interested in using statistical methods for solving and analysing complex models and dynamical systems, and quantifying the uncertainty in the model parameters, model predictions, and model error that appear in cardiac electrophysiology as well as other biomedical applications.

Recently, I begin to deal in studying experimental errors or artefacts, especially when we _know_ the experimental set up _is_ imperfect.
Can we quantitatively describe such an experimental error through mathematical modelling?
To answer that question, I, together with [Gary Mirams](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/people/gary.mirams), [David Gavaghan](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/david.gavaghan/), [Teun de Boer](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/research/researchers/de-boer-teun-p-tp) and co., developed a mathematical model describing the experimental artefacts in patch-calmp voltage-clamp experiments.
We found that using such a model can account for most of the cell-cell variability that we observed in hERG ion channel kinetics.
The voltage clamp experiment model that we developed is also a very useful educational tool.
I have created a free online app using the model for understanding (or even to get a feel for) what the amplifier does under the hood:
