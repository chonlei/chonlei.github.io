Functional classification of genetic variants is a key for their clinical applications in patient care.
However, abundant variant data generated by the next-generation DNA sequencing technologies limit the use of experimental methods for their classification.
Here, we developed a protein structure and deep learning (DL)-based system for genetic variant classification, DL-RP-MDS, which comprises two principles:
1) Extracting protein structural and thermodynamics information using the Ramachandran plot-molecular dynamics simulation (RP-MDS) method,
2) combining those data with an unsupervised learning model of auto-encoder and a neural network classifier to identify the statistical significance patterns of the structural changes.
We observed that DL-RP-MDS provided higher specificity than over 20 widely used in silico methods in classifying the variants of three DNA damage repair genes: TP53, MLH1, and MSH2.
DL-RP-MDS offers a powerful platform for high-throughput genetic variant classification.
