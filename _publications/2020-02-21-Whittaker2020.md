Cardiac electrophysiology models are among the most mature and well‚Äêstudied mathematical models of biological systems.
This maturity is bringing new challenges as models are being used increasingly to make quantitative rather than qualitative predictions.
As such, calibrating the parameters within ion current and action potential (AP) models to experimental data sets is a crucial step in constructing a predictive model.
This review highlights some of the fundamental concepts in cardiac model calibration and is intended to be readily understood by computational and mathematical modelers working in other fields of biology.
We discuss the classic and latest approaches to calibration in the electrophysiology field, at both the ion channel and cellular AP scales.
We end with a discussion of the many challenges that work to date has raised and the need for reproducible descriptions of the calibration process to enable models to be recalibrated to new data sets and built upon for new studies.
